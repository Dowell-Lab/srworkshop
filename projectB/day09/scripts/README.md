# Short Read Day 9: 
- Author: Meaghan Courvan

**The goal of Day 9** is to become familiar with how to draw comparisons between ChIP-seq and RNA-seq data using the bioinformatics tool bedtools. Then we will practice making figures in R. You've already made many figure in R, using both the base R function *plot()* and the more advanced *ggplot2()*. Here, we'll talk about other plotting packages. In addition, we'll get you ready for making publication-quality figures by diving more into plotting options that let you control the aesthetics.
