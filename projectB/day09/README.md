# Short Read Project B, Day 9
- Author: Meaghan Courvan

**Goals for Day 9**
1. Become familiar with how to draw comparisons between ChIP-seq and RNA-seq data using the bioinformatics tool bedtools. T
2. Expand your abilities to plot data in R. We'll talk about other plotting packages. In addition, we'll get you ready for making publication-quality figures by diving more into plotting options that let you control the aesthetics. 
3. GO analysis to look for functional enrichment in our results.
