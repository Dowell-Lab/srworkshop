# Project B Day 7 | RNA-seq: Counting Reads and Differential Expression

Today we will count RNA-seq reads and use the counts to run *DESeq2*.

First, you will learn to count reads using *featureCounts*. Then, you will learn about exploratory data analysis and QC checks associated with differential analysis. Finally, you will use the differential analysis pipeline *DESeq2* to identify a list of genes which are differentially expressed in our dataset. This list will be used later in the week when we integrate it together with our ChIP-seq results.

###

BEFORE WE START
We will do the M and M example. 
Please count your M and Ms and put them here.

If you are online, I'm sorry we can't give you candy. First login to tha AWS and cd into srworkshop and git pull.  Simulate getting candy by running. You can change the size of your handfull to anything between 50 and 150. Here I have it set to 100.

## In-class Worksheets

1. We will start with counting reads using *featureCounts*. Since counting requires more resources, we will be coutning reads on the AWS server. 

- `Day7_featurecounts_worksheet.pdf` worksheet with details on running *featureCounts*
- `d7_featureCounts.R` R script with code to count reads using *featureCounts* from *Rsubread*
- `d7_featureCounts.sbatch` sbatch script that calls the aboive R scripts allowing us to count reads on the server

2. Second, we will perform differential gene expression analysis with *DESeq2*. This process will take in as input read counts from featureCounts.

- `Day7_differential_expression_worksheet.pdf` A worksheet with R code we will run in Rstudio to perform differential gene experession analysis

## Homework

The homework is to perform differential gene expession analysis on a new dataset. In the homework folder, the counts for the dataset are already generated. You will need to generate your own conditions table.
