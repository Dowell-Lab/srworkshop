<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:24.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The
M and M example </span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Steps</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>For this
example, I had two types of Ziploc bags, one had pictures of the movie Frozen
and the other Starwars. You don't have to use those pictures. Marshmallows are
our spike ins. Therefore, The one thing I tell the students is that the number
of Marshmallows is consistent between the two bowls.</span></p>

<ol start=1 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Have
     half of the room use Frozen bag and fill it with one cup of candy from
     Bowl 1. Have the other half of the room fill a starwars bag with 2 cups of
     candy.</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Have
     everyone count each color of M and M and each size of Marshmallows. Each
     person then puts it into the google doc under the &quot;master
     numbers&quot; tab. Each individual gets to decide how they
     &quot;count&quot; the skittles.</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Sample
     size-- How similar are biological replicates?-- Depends on seq depth and
     expression level of the gene.: </span></li>
 <ol start=1 type=1>
  <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Each
      person does fold change with a partner that has the same bag type as
      them. The fold change is parter_1_value/partner_2_value. For example,
      Partner1 has 4 blue M and Ms and partner 2 has 2 blue M and Ms so the
      fold change is 2. Put those numbers in the partner fc tab. What should
      the fold change be? How variable are the fold changes across the colors
      and the partner_sets?</span></li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Now
      divide all M and Ms by the total number of M and Ms you collected in your
      cup. Do fold change again. What should the fold change be? How variable
      are the fold changes across the colors and the partner_sets?</span></li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Copy
      one of the two bags (I used frozen) into a new tab on the spread sheet
      and do fold change on 1/2 the group vs the other 1/2. Is it near 1? (do
      this with both sample size corrected data and not corrected data.) Why
      does sample size correction change the numbers. Should we correct for
      sample size?</span></li>
 </ol>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Two
     sample comparison </span></li>
 <ol start=1 type=1>
  <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Now
      have each person get a partner with a different bag. Calculate fc. Calculate
      fc while correcting for sample size. What is happened?</span></li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Now
      divide by marshmallows instead of sample size. Does it give a different
      answer.</span></li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Now calculate
      the final values across the class, not correcting, correcting for sample
      size, and correcting for marshmallows. Which is most accurate and why?</span></li>
 </ol>
 <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Oddness
     in &quot;skittles&quot;. Skittles represent reads in our fastq that we
     don't know what to do with. </span></li>
 <ol start=1 type=1>
  <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>What
      are they: Skittles can be multiple mapping reads. What do we do with multiply
      mapping reads? Sometimes we put them in multiple places, sometimes we ignore
      them. Skittles can also be reads from contamination. Again, what do we do
      with them.</span></li>
  <li class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Answer,
      is there is no real right answer. We just have to make a choice and home
      they are in both of our samples, and therefore the &quot;noise&quot; is
      not that important.</span></li>
