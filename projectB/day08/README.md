# Project B Day 8 | RNA-seq: Advanced DESeq2 Methods and Investigating Gene Lists

Today we will do more practice with DESeq2, discuss more subtleties of analysis and create advanced condition designs in order to address them. We will also cover downstream analysis of differentially expressed genes.
