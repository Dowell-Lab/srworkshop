# Project B | ChIP-seq Analsys Homework

1. Run MEME on the HCT116 DMSO samples

- Compare the output to the output to the HCT116 NUTLIN output. (Note that we get P53 motif enriched in the NUTLIN samples)

2. Process the MCF7 samples through the ChIP-seq worksheet.

The fastq files for the other cell lines are located on AWS here `/scratch/Shares/public/sread2024/homework_data_files/day8b/fastq`
