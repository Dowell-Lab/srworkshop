# Project B | Multi-omics: RNA-seq/ChIP-seq/ATAC-seq

The goal for this project is that you will get experience working with RNA-seq data and ChIP-seq data. I'm sure you've read papers that used both, and it's a powerful approach because combining information from multiple modalities allows you to make more specific and supported claims from the data.

## Project outline
### Day 1
Learn how to count reads and perform differential expression. \
Key R packages: 

* Rsubread
* DESeq2

### Day 2
Learn how to work with ChIPseq data \
Key programs: 

* MACS

### Day 3
Learn how to easily perform comparisons between genomic datasets, make figures, and look for functional enrichment. \
Key programs: 

* bedtools
* ggvenn
* pheatmap
* PantherGO
