# Project B | Multi-omics: RNA-seq/ChIP-seq/ATAC-seq

The goal for day 9 is to discuss more peak-centric sequencing methods. To this end we will cover the basic analysis of ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq. For this we will learn to use MACS2 and the different settings required in peak calling depending on the type of data. We also will discuss index files, post-sequencing QC, bedtools, and a few other key concepts.
