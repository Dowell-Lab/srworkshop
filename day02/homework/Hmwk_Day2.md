## Short Read Workshop -- Homework Day 2

1. First, practice `mkdir` by making a directory called `<your_name>_Rocks` (so if my name is Laura it'd be Laura_Rocks). Then figure out how to make more than one file at once in it.
2. Use `rsync` to copy this directory into your home directory: `/scratch/Shares/public/sread2025/scripts/day2` 
	- Hint: This requires the recursive flag and the flag for all files (you can use `man` to figure out those flags)
3. **THIS IS MOST IMPORTANT:** Work through the Vim tutorial available on the server by typing in the command vimtutor.
4. Watch videos for day 3.

Great job!
