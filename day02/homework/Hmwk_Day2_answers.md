2. Then I made the directory I wanted and checked it was there with ls

3. Then I ran rsync. Notice the -r flag. That stands for recursive which means the directory and everything in it.

4. Then I check if rsync worked by cd into that folder and useing ls to see the files.

5. Make sure you practice vimtutor some more before tomorrow!
