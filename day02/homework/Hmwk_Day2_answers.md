This is how I did the homework.


1. First I loged on to the super computer

2. Then I made the directory I wanted and checked it was there with ls

3. Then I ran rsync. Notice the -r flag. That stands for recursive which means the directory and everything in it.

Then I check if rsync worked by cd into that folder and useing ls to see the files. 

Why do I have a / before scracth but not before Mary_Rocks? Do you remember? If not make sure to look up linux relative vs absolute paths. 

4.  Make sure you practice vimtutor some more before tomorrow!
