## Short Read Workshop -- Homework Day 2

1. First, practice mkdir by making a directory called "<your_name>_Rocks" (so if my name is Laura it'd be Laura_Rocks). Then figure out how to make more than one file at once in it.
2. Use rsync to copy the directory from this github repo into your home directory (make sure you are careful about absolute paths!): ~/sr2024/day02/scripts/day2_scripts
	- Hint: This requires the recursive flag and the flag for all files (you can use man to figure out those flags)
3. **THIS IS MOST IMPORTANT:** If you haven't already, finish working through the Vim tutorial available on the server by typing in the command vimtutor.
4. Watch videos for day 3.

Great job!
