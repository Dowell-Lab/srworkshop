# GO analysis walkthrough
Authors: Mary Allen, Jesse Kurland

## How does GO term enrichment work?
Example: aged vs adult scRNA-seq from mouse muscle
- Do differentially expressed genes preferentially fall in specific categories?
    - 1000 differentially expressed genes found in aged mice vs. adult mice
    - In background gene set (all genes and putative genes):
        - 20,000 total genes in mm10
        - 100 genes involved in 'innervation of skeletal muscle'
    - In differentially expressed gene set:
        - 10 genes involved in innervation - not significant!
        - 100 genes involved in innervation - **significant!**

## Gathering your gene lists

### Before you run DESeq2 
- Decide on which annotation GTF you will use because some annotations have more genes than others
    - Pro for NCBI/Ensable GTFs: they have way more non-coding RNAs
    - Con for NCBI/Ensable GTFs: they have way more non-coding RNAs, which means more multiple hypothesis correction and therefore fewer significant differentially expressed genes.  

### After running DESeq2 with counts using that annotation file
- How do I pick my DESeq2 cut-off?
    - Draw a histogram of the p-values in your results
    ![hist command](md_images/hist_command.png)\
    ![histograms of pvalues](md_images/histograms_of_pvalues.png)
    - Imagine a blue line at your cut-off and a green line that goes flat across the bins. 
        - These two lines help you to think about your True Positives, False Positives, True Negatives, and False negatives. If you reduce your cut-off you get less genes as significant, but more of them are true positives and less of them are false positives. 

- How do get my gene lists out of R from Deseq2?
    - To run GO you will need a significantly different genes list and a background gene list. 
        - Background gene lists? Which one?
            - If you could not have called it as differentially expressed it should not be in your background gene list. 
    - The last few lines of this script gather your background gene list and your significant gene list. 
        - Genes that are too low or variable to test for differential expression display `NA` in the `padj` column.

## Enrichr (maayanlab.cloud/Enrichr/)
- Pros and cons of Enrichr
    - Conducts multiple comparisons
    - Doesn’t permit using background gene set
    - Great for first pass checks of what you should explore more
    - Not the most statically accurate due to the lack of background lists

![Enrichr homepage](md_images/enrichr_homepage.png)

- Using Enrichr
    - Paste enriched gene list into box and “submit”  
    ![Enrichr gene list entry](md_images/enrichr_genelist_entry.png)

## Panther (http://geneontology.org)
- Pros and cons of Panther
    - Allows using background gene sets
    - Provides “Molecular Pathways”

- Using Panther
    - Paste enriched gene list into box and “Launch” 
    ![Panther gene list entry](md_images/panther_genelist_entry.png)
    ![Panther change background set](md_images/panther_change_bg_set.png)
    - Make sure background gene set is in a text file
