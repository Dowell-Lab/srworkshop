## Sequencing experiments are just like any other experiment...
They are best with a clear hypothesis and good controls. You should be able to succinctly articulate what question you'll ask of your data and *have a plan to process the data to answer it*. Otherwise, your experiment probably needs more planning. 

Sometimes people sequence because they don't know what else to do. The problem? Sequencing generates *massive amounts of data* that now you need to interpret. With nowhere to start. That's a recipe for a lot of time and money spent for little payout. 

**TL;DR**  The best way to get from a gene list to a publication is to 
1. Have a clear question
2. Know your field well and why your question is important
3. Learn to make good figures

Read on to learn more about making good figures! 


### First, is a gene list good for anything? YES!!
A gene list is good for lots of things! Here are the top things to use it for: 
**1. Check your positive and negative controls.** Every experiment should have control genes you expect to change in a predictable way. Make sure your controls are acting as you expect. You don't want to analyze a dataset if your treatment didn't even work. 
**2. Are the top changing genes interesting to people in your field?** Sometimes the most differentially expressed genes are a direct hint as to what sort of changes are going on in your experiment.
