### Day 3 worksheets

Follow the day3_worksheet.md. This will take you through how to build sbatch scripts as well as how to load modules and use a few new commands.

Do your best to work through this worksheet yourself/with others. Struggling through this is the best way to learn. **But** if you're completely stuck, solution scripts are in the `day03/scripts/` directory of the repo (`.day3_solution_part1.sbatch` and `.day3_solution_part2.sbatch`). These are hidden files, so you need to view them with `ls -a`, and it's recommended to rename them something that isn't hidden (doesn't start with `.`) before using them.
