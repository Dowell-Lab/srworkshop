### Day 3 worksheets

Follow the day3_worksheet.md. This will take you through how to build sbatch scripts as well as how to load modules and use a few new commands.

Do your best to work through this yourself/with others. **But** if you're completely stuck, solution scripts are in the day03/scripts/ directory of the repo (.day3_solution_part1.sbatch and .day3_solution_part2.sbatch). These are hidden files, so you need to view them with ls -a, and it's recommended to rename them something that isn't hidden (doesn't start with `.`) before using them.
