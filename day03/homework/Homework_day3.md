Short Read Workshop – Homework Day 3

1. In class today, we learned how to write an sbatch script and submit it with some basic parameters. Create a new directory in your scratch directory called “homework-day3.” Create an sbatch script that will output the date, sleep for 2 minutes, and run date again to show the 2 minutes difference.
	a. HINT: `sleep` is a command you have not used yet. Look at the man page for it. `date` is also a command you may not have used.
2. Write a second sbatch script and download (using `wget`) some 1000 genomes data. If you don’t want to pick some custom data, use `ftp://ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/SRR792/SRR792473/SRR792473_1.fastq.gz`. If you’re feeling adventurous, you can try to find your own data! (http://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/pilot_data/data/)
    - You can also use the command `curl` instead of wget.
	- **NOTE:** The downloads will take longer than in class today since we’re pulling much larger files than we did in class today. Be patient, be persistent, and you will be successful.
3. In an sbatch script, run FastQC on the fastq.gz file. Make sure the error and output files look as you’d expect!
    - Extra credit: use the `date` command before and after your `curl` and `fastqc` command for multiple different SRR files. Then look in output files and see how long it took you to download the SRR files today. Which one took more time? What are the file sizes of the SRR files? Do the time and the file size correlate?
4. Rsync the html FastQC output file to your local machine, open it, and view the results.
5. Back up the scripts and FastQC output to your home directory.
6. Delete the fastq file(s) that you downloaded. We won't use these again, and they take up disk space. Plus, if you ever needed them again, you could download them again with your script.
7. Watch the videos for day 4
