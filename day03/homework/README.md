### Day 3 homework

Follow Homework_day3.md. This will provide more practice on building sbatch scripts and running FastQC.

Do your best to work through this homework yourself/with others. Struggling through this is the best way to learn. **But** if you're completely stuck, solution scripts are in the `day03/scripts/` directory within the repo (`.homework_day3_solution_part1.sbatch` and `.homework_day3_solution_part2-3.sbatch`). These are hidden files, so you need to view them with `ls -a`, and it's recommended to rename them something that isn't hidden (doesn't start with `.`) before using them.
