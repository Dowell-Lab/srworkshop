### Day 3 homework

Follow Homework_day3.md. This will provide more practice on building sbatch scripts and running FastQC.

Do your best to work through this yourself/with others. **But** if you're completely stuck, solution scripts are in the day03/scripts/ directory of the repo (.homework_day3_solution_part1.sbatch and .homework_day3_solution_part2-3.sbatch). These are hidden files, so you need to view them with ls -a, and it's recommended to rename them something that isn't hidden (doesn't start with `.`) before using them.
