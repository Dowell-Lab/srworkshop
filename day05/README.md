# Day 5 | Assessment

Today it's about catching up and making sure we are ready for next week! 

**Goals**:
* Use `for` loops to process multiple FASTQ files to compressed visualization files. 
* Quick assessment to make sure everyone is comfortable with the first week of the workshop. If this takes >2hr, *it is a good idea to go home over the weekend and review/practice skills from the first week*. The second week will be at a much quicker pace!
