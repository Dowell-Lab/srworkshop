# Day 6 | Introduction to R

This workshop gives an introduction to R! Briefly, R is a statistical programming language with a wide array of applications. In this workshop you will learn how to run R code in a few environments. You will learn basic R commands, how to load tables, save tables, plot publication ready figures and save all these files.

## Inclass Worksheets

We will cover running R three ways:

1. In an R console

- `Day6_worksheet1_Introduction_to_R.md`  

2. In RStudio 

- `Day6_worksheet2_R_in_Rstudio.md` and `Learning_R.R` will guide you

3. Submitting and R script as an sbatch job

- `Learning_R_submit_aws.R` R script
- `Submit_Rscript.sbatch` sbatch script calling the `Learning_R_submit_aws.R` R script

4. R challenge for really advanced students
   Find some data online or some data you own.
   Copy that to the super computer
   Make an R script to graph info for one subsection of the data
   Create a sbatch script that runs the R script
   Graph every suubsection via the R script
   

## Homework

1. Homework can be done in R Studio

- `Learning_R_Additional_Practice.R`

2. Additional homework is to install R packages we will use later in the week. Both packages can be found on bioconductor.
