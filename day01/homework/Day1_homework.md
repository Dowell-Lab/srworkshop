## Library QC homework
In class, we talked about how to read FastQC reports in the context of determining if there are overarching problems with a sequencing library.

Here, your job is to look at some FastQC reports to determine if a library looks good or whether it has problems (and what those problems might be). For each library, briefly answer the following questions: 

1.	Does this library pass general QC? 

2.	If not:
    - What QC metric(s) show problems with the library?
    - What might be the biological or technological source of the problem(s)?
