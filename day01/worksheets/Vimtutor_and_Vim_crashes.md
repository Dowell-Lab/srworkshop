# Getting started with Vimtutor

## Background to Vim
Vim is a text editor, vaguely similar to Word but with much less graphical user interface. It's decades old and fairly complicated to learn, but it is able to be used on the command line and was specifically developed for programming.

Vim does have a steep learning curve, and Vimtutor is a program within Vim that is intended to help you learn it. As you go through, remember not to try to memorize all of the commands. Just remember that a command for something exists. You can always Google it later.

## Vimtutor directions
<ol>
<li>Open a terminal</li>
<li>Run the command <code>vimtutor</code></li>
<li>As you'll soon learn, if you need to quit out of Vim/Vimtutor, type <code>:q</code></li>
<li>Follow the instructions you see in Vimtutor</li>
</ol>

## What to do if Vim crashes
There will come a time that Vim will crash while you are in the midst of writing/editing. This most frequently happens if you close a terminal or are logged off of a supercomputer with Vim still open. Here's what to do if that happens.

<ul>
<li>
As you're editing a file in Vim, it automatically saves any changes into a <code>.swp</code> file, which is analagous to the recovery file generated by Word. This is a hidden file in the same directory as the edited file that can be seen (through a different terminal window) with the command <code>ls -al</code>

(I have this example.txt file open and edited in Vim in another terminal window)
</li>
<li>
If you save (write) the file changes and exit Vim normally, the <code>.swp</code> file is deleted. But if Vim crashes, this <code>.swp</code> file remains in the directory and needs to be handled.
</li>
</ul>

1. Open a new file in Vim in any directory (`vim <filename>`) and edit it with any text (`i` to enter insert mode, then text). Save the text (`Esc` to exit insert mode, then `:w`). Then go back into insert mode and write something else.

2. Close your terminal window.

3. Open a new terminal window, log into the AWS (if that's where you made your file), and navigate back to your file's directory.

4. Run `ls -al` to see the `.swp` file.

5. Run `diff <filename> .<filename>.swp` to see the differences between the two files.

6. Try to open the file (`vim <filename>`). You'll see something like this:\
![Vim recovery message](md_images/vim_recovery_message.png)

7. Your options for what to do are along the bottom. Choose the option that you'd like by the capital letter indicated.

8. Once you have chosen your option, and properly saved your file if you need to, quit out of Vim again. Run `ls -al` again. You'll see that the `.swp` file is still there.

9. Manually delete the `.swp` file to avoid getting the same message again. (`rm .<filename>.swp`)
