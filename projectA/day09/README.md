# Day 9, Analyzing scRNA-seq 
### Authors: Georgia Barone (2024), Mary Allen (2024)

Today, we will explore two ways to analyze processed scRNA-seq data. The first will be with the package CellChat. This software helps us infer which cell types are communicating in scRNA-seq data.**[Mary insert psuedo time information here]**

1. Start with `CellChat-Worksheeet.md` in the `worksheets/` directory
2. After completing the CellChat worksheet move on pseudotime.md
